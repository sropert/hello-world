# hello-world

This is a test repository.

There should be a readme for each repository. 

Each project should have a seperate repository.By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

The default branch is considered the “base” branch in your repository, against which all pull requests and code commits are automatically made, unless you specify a different branch. 

On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
